## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Datalocker?

Datalocker is designed to help individuals and families seeking permanent supportive housing and other City-provided services. Datalocker facilitates the storage and sharing of personal documents with case managers and relevant City agencies. It is also intended to improve the provision of government services. The system is free, simple, and secure.

Datalocker can be accessed via web browser on desktop and mobile devices. All users must have an email account. Datalocker is in an early pilot stage of development.

### What challenges does Datalocker address?

Missing documentation is often cited as one of the primary reasons for benefit application denials. Individuals or families in need of benefits, such as public housing, may not be able to easily retrieve or produce documents to verify that they meet eligibility requirements. Additionally, on the City agency side, missing documentation can make a lengthy process even more time-consuming and arduous for both government employees and residents. Datalocker has been designed to address these challenges.

### If I want to submit documents to apply for permanent supportive housing, do I have to use Datalocker?

No. Datalocker is an option for residents. It isn’t required. However, it may make the process of producing and sharing necessary documents easier for those who choose to use it.

### Does using Datalocker mean I will receive permanent supportive housing from the City?

No. Datalocker is a tool that facilitates the collection and sharing of documents necessary for the application process. Using Datalocker does not guarantee a user will be matched with permanent supportive housing.

### Can I use Datalocker to apply for other City services?

No. At this time, we are piloting Datalocker. Datalocker can be used solely to provide documents necessary for permanent supportive housing applications. Future versions of Datalocker may be used to apply for other benefits, but we are still in the early stages of development and testing.

### Is Datalocker secure?

We are committed to ensuring that Datalocker is as secure as possible. We encrypt all data end-to-end and any data we store is fully encrypted at rest. End-to-end encryption ensures only authorized users can access documents and unauthorized parties cannot access private information being stored by, or sent to or from, Datalocker. The system is built and run in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to further ensure the best privacy practices and protections for users.

### Do I control who is able to see my documents through Datalocker?

Yes. Datalocker users can choose to share documents with specific authorized people - case managers/social workers and/or City employees. Documents are shared for the sole purpose of verifying eligibility for benefits. Users need to know the email address of each recipient in order to share documents through Datalocker. The system can only share documents with the email accounts of authorized government agencies. If a user is not sure with which individuals or agencies documents should be shared, they need to ask their case manager.

Users choose who can see the documents they share. They can also revoke sharing. However, if a user shares documents and subsequently chooses to revoke sharing, the documents that had been shared may have been shared or downloaded by a City case manager before sharing was revoked. All users are encouraged to read Datalocker’s Terms of Use for a full description of data management protocols.

### Will Datalocker create a record of my activity in the system? For example, if I share a document with my case manager, will I be able to see that record in 6 months?

Yes. There is a record in Datalocker of all activity associated with an account. Users can choose to access past activity or view documents they have shared.

### Can someone else use Datalocker on my behalf?

Yes, it is possible to authorize someone else to act on a user’s behalf. Datalocker gives users the control to allow their case manager to access their entire Datalocker account. If access has been granted to a case manager, they’ll be able to add and share documents with agencies on behalf of a user.

### Do I have to pay to use Datalocker?

No. Datalocker is a free service.

### What does pilot stage of development mean?

The pilot stage means Datalocker is being used by a small group of people to test the tool, learn from the test, and then invite more people to use it, or revise it. The pilot will be used to establish that Datalocker does what it is intended to do: help residents more efficiently produce and share necessary documents to apply for services, and improve the provision of government services. There are two cities currently testing the system, New York and Baltimore. Both cities are using Datalocker to facilitate the sharing of documents in support of applications for permanent supportive housing.

### Can I download Datalocker from an app store?

No, Datalocker is not an app that you need to download. It is available online. Datalocker can be accessed via web browser on desktop and mobile devices.
