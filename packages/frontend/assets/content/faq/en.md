## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is My Digital Data Locker?

My Digital Data Locker is designed to help individuals and families seeking permanent supportive housing and other City-provided services. My Digital Data Locker facilitates the storage and sharing of personal documents with case managers and relevant City agencies. It is also intended to improve the provision of government services. The system is free, simple, and secure.

My Digital Data Locker can be accessed via web browser on desktop and mobile devices. All users must have an email account. My Digital Data Locker is in an early pilot stage of development.

### What challenges does My Digital Data Locker address?

Missing documentation is often cited as one of the primary reasons for benefit application denials. Individuals or families in need of benefits, ,such as public housing, may not be able to easily retrieve or produce documents to verify that they meet eligibility requirements. Additionally, on the City agency side, missing documentation can make a lengthy process even more time-consuming and arduous for both government employees and residents. My Digital Data Locker has been designed to address these challenges.

### If I want to submit documents to apply for permanent supportive housing, do I have to use My Digital Data Locker?

No. My Digital Data Locker is an option for residents. It isn’t required. However, it may make the process of producing and sharing necessary documents easier for those who choose to use it.

### Does using My Digital Data Locker mean I will receive permanent supportive housing from the City?

No. My Digital Data Locker is a tool that facilitates the collection and sharing of documents necessary for the application process. Using My Digital Data Locker does not guarantee a user will be matched with permanent supportive housing.

### Can I use My Digital Data Locker to apply for other City services?

No. At this time, we are piloting My Digital Data Locker. My Digital Data Locker can be used solely to provide documents necessary for permanent supportive housing applications. Future versions of My Digital Data Locker may be used to apply for other benefits, but we are still in the early stages of development and testing.

### Is My Digital Data Locker secure?

We are committed to ensuring that My Digital Data Locker is as secure as possible. We encrypt all data end-to-end and any data we store is fully encrypted at rest. End-to-end encryption ensures only authorized users can access documents and unauthorized parties cannot access private information being stored by, or sent to or from, My Digital Data Locker. The system is built and run in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to further ensure the best privacy practices and protections for users.

Personal records in My Digital Data Locker Baltimore will not be stored in city or government systems. No user content will be shared with any entity that the user has not specifically authorized. No user content will ever be sold or used for marketing purposes.

### Do I control who is able to see my documents through My Digital Data Locker?

Yes. My Digital Data Locker users can choose to share documents with specific authorized people - case managers/social workers and/or City employees. Documents are shared for the sole purpose of verifying eligibility for benefits. Users need to know the email address of each recipient in order to share documents through My Digital Data Locker. The system can only share documents with the email accounts of authorized government agencies. If a user is not sure with which individuals or agencies documents should be shared, they need to ask their case manager.

Users choose who can see the documents they share. They can also revoke sharing. However, if a user shares documents and subsequently chooses to revoke sharing, the documents that had been shared may have been shared or downloaded by a City case manager before sharing was revoked. All users are encouraged to read My Digital Data Locker’s Terms of Use for a full description of data management protocols.

In the event of unauthorized use or access to My Digital Data Locker please report misuse to mydigitaldatalockerhelp@twobulls.com.

### Will My Digital Data Locker create a record of my activity in the system? For example, if I share a document with my case manager, will I be able to see that record in 6 months?

Yes. There is a record in My Digital Data Locker of all activity associated with an account. Users can choose to access past activity or view documents they have shared.

### Can someone else use My Digital Data Locker on my behalf?

Yes, it is possible to authorize someone else to act on a user’s behalf. My Digital Data Locker gives users the control to allow their case manager to access their entire My Digital Data Locker account. If access has been granted to a case manager, they’ll be able to add and share documents with agencies on behalf of a user.

### Do I have to pay to use My Digital Data Locker?

No. My Digital Data Locker is a free service.

### What does pilot stage of development mean?

The pilot stage means My Digital Data Locker is being used by a small group of people to test the tool, learn from the test, and then invite more people to use it, or revise it. The pilot will be used to establish that My Digital Data Locker does what it is intended to do: help residents more efficiently produce and share necessary documents to apply for services, and improve the provision of government services. There are two cities currently testing the system, New York and Baltimore. Both cities are using My Digital Data Locker to facilitate the sharing of documents in support of applications for permanent supportive housing.
