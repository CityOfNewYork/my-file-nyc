### How do I create an account and get started with My File NYC?

Get started with My File NYC using your NYC account, also known as NYC.ID (a single username and password for accessing many NYC services including My File NYC). Sign up with your existing NYC.ID if you have one or create a new account. You can also use your ACCESS HRA account if you have one.
 
### If I already have a NYC.ID account, how do I use it to log into My File? 
 
If you already have a NYC.ID or ACCESS HRA account, you can log in with the same username and password, or using a social media account such as Facebook or Google.

Not sure if you have a NYC.ID account? Use the “Forgot Password” form to see if you have an account.
 
### I don’t have a NYC.ID, how do I create one and get started with My File NYC? 
 
To use your email, scroll down to “Create an Account.” Create a username and password and then continue.
 
To login using another account (Facebook/Google/Apple/etc) scroll down to the provider and click their logo. Use the username and password that you normally would to login to those accounts. After you finish signing up you can log into My File by clicking on the logo of the service that provides the account you linked to NYC.ID.
