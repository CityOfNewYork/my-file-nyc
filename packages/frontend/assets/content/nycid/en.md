### How do I create an account and get started with My File NYC?

Get started with My File NYC using NYC.ID (a single username and password for accessing many NYC services including My File NYC). Sign up with your existing NYC.ID if you have one or create a new account. 
 
### If I already have a NYC.ID account, how do I use it to log into My File? 
 
If you already have a NYC.ID, you can log in with a username and password, or using a social media account such as Facebook or Google. 
 
### I don’t have a NYC.ID, how do I create one and get started with My File NYC? 
 
To use your email, scroll down to “Create an Account.” Create a username and password and then continue.
 
To login using another account (Facebook/Google/Apple/etc) scroll down to the provider and click their logo. Use the username and password that you normally would to login to those accounts. After you finish signing up you can log into My File by clicking on the logo of the service that provides the account you linked to NYC.ID.
