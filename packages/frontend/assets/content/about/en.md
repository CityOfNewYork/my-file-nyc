## About My File

My File NYC allows families to upload and share documents with the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) during their applications for shelter. It is also a safe and secure place for families to store their private documents for safekeeping to download and use for other things.

My File NYC is managed by the [NYC Mayor’s Office of Opportunity](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/index.page) in collaboration with the [Department of Homeless Services](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dhs/index.page). Throughout development, My File NYC has been supported by other organizations including [New America](https://www.newamerica.org/), [Two Bulls](https://www.twobulls.com/) and [The Rockefeller Foundation](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/).

My File NYC can be accessed via web browser on desktop and mobile devices. It is an open source tool maintained by the New York City Mayor’s Office of Opportunity and our partners. 

My File is currently in pilot.
