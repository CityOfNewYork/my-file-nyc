## About Baltimore My Digital Data Locker

Baltimore My Digital Data Locker is designed to help residents more efficiently store and share necessary documentation with case managers and Baltimore City agencies to receive services. The system is free, simple, and secure. It is also intended to improve the provision of government services.

Baltimore My Digital Data Locker can be accessed via web browser on desktop and mobile devices. It is in an early pilot stage of development and is currently being tested with a community of individuals experiencing homelessness who are working to secure permanent supportive housing. This open source tool was built in collaboration with the City of Baltimore, The Journey Home, New America, Two Bulls, Amazon Web Services (AWS), The Rockefeller Foundation, Kaiser Permanente, and The Annie E Casey Foundation.
