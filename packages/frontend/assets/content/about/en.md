## About My File NYC

My File NYC is a web-based tool that facilitates the management and sharing of personal documents with case managers and City agencies. The system is simple, free for use, and secure. My File NYC gives residents greater control over their personal information while improving the provision of government services. The solution was developed in collaboration with the [City of Baltimore’s Mayor’s Office of Homeless Services](https://homeless.baltimorecity.gov/), [The Journey Home](https://journeyhomebaltimore.org/), [New America](https://www.newamerica.org/), [Two Bulls](https://www.twobulls.com/), [The Rockefeller Foundation](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/), [Kaiser Permanente](https://community.kp.org/grants-and-volunteering/funding-opportunities), [The Annie E Casey Foundation](https://www.aecf.org/), and [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/). This open source platform [was released](https://github.com/newamericafoundation/digi-datalocker) in Beta by New America's Digital Impact and Governance Initiative [(DIGI)](https://www.newamerica.org/digital-impact-governance-initiative/).
